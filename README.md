 Financial Tracker
## Description of the Project

is a Java-based console application that helps users record and manage their personal financial transactions. The application 
allows users to track deposits and payments, view a complete ledger, and generate financial reports based on date or vendor. 
The main goal of this tool is to simplify expense tracking for individuals who want to understand and manage 
their financial habits without using complicated software.

Intended users are individuals who want a simple, lightweight financial tool to record and review transactions over time. The application reads and writes to a CSV file, making it easy to persist data between sessions.
